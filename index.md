## Intro

**Hi!** I'm Craig and I have worked in IT and Cybersecurity since 2011. In that time, I have done a little bit of (almost) everything. From Windows desktop support and managing printers to Linux server provisioning and Microsoft 365 administration. I am a creative and interested person who enjoys solving complex issues and sharing knowledge. 

Outside of work I enjoy photography, films, playing music and a nice wine or craft beer.

I am based in *Perth, Western Australia.*
